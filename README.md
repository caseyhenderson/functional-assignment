# functional-assignment

This is my assignment project for the Functional Programming module.
In this project I will tackle two main questions.
Firstly: a program that converts Morse Code into ASCII.
Secondly: a program that takes data from the Central England Temperature records to answer three questions.
    1) Find the warmest day for each calendar month (e.g. the warmest January day, warmest February day and so on).
    2) Find the warmest and coldest years.
    3) Find the mean temperature for each calendar month (the average for all Mays, for example) and the instance of each month that has the greatest and smallest variation from that mean.
